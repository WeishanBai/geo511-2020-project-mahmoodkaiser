# Introduction

Towing of vehicles is a huge problem and there may be a lot of factor that could influence towing. In this project I tried to explore the towing data in buffalo to figure out any potential spatial relation of towing with location, and roadway and demographic characteristics.

# Materials and methods

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(leaflet)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(tidyverse)
library(mapview)
library(leafpop)
library(sf)
library(sp)
